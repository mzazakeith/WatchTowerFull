# WatchTower: Enhanced Service Monitoring System

## 1. System Overview

### 1.1 Introduction
WatchTower is a robust monitoring system designed with a beautiful, modern and elegant user interface to track the health and performance of web services, APIs, and server resources across cloud and on-premises environments. It provides detailed health metrics, customizable thresholds, real-time alerts, and advanced analytics.

### 1.2 Core Features
- **Service Health Monitoring**: Configurable checks and thresholds for service health.
- **Server Resource Monitoring**: CPU, memory, disk, and network metrics (Future).
- **Customizable Dashboards**: Real-time visualization of metrics.
- **Multi-level Alerting**: Alerts with escalation paths.
- **Historical Data Analysis**: Trend reporting and anomaly detection.
- **Incident Management**: Tracking and resolution of service disruptions.
- **User Management**: Role-based access control for teams and users.

## 2. Detailed Architecture

### 2.1 Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Recharts, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes with Express.js integration
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ORM
- **Authentication**: Passwordless via email or WhatsApp (logging auth codes initially; notifications to be implemented later).
- **Monitoring Agents**: Node.js-based agents for on-premises servers (in the Future not now).
- **Cloud Integration**: AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, GCP Monitoring APIs (in the Future not now).
- **Task Scheduling**: Bull and Redis for scheduled tasks.

- Triggers alerts and persists monitoring data.

#### 2.2.2 Resource Monitoring Agents (Future)
- Collect system metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network).
- Report metrics to the core service.

#### 2.2.3 Alert Manager
- Evaluates and routes alerts.
- Supports multiple notification channels (Email, SMS, Slack, whatsapp,etc.).
- Tracks alert acknowledgment and resolution.

#### 2.2.4 Analytics Engine
- Generates trend reports and identifies anomalies.
- Provides forecasting and capacity planning insights.

#### 2.2.5 Management Interface
- Web-based dashboard for configuration, monitoring, and reporting.

## 3. Monitoring Capabilities

### 3.1 Service Health Monitoring
- **Health Indicators**: Availability, response time, reliability, content validation, SSL certificate validity, and service dependencies.
- **Check Types**: Ping, HTTP/HTTPS, API endpoints, database connections, DNS resolution, SSL/TCP/UDP port checks, and custom scripts.

### 3.2 Server Resource Monitoring (Future)
- **On-premises Servers**: Agent-based collection of CPU, memory, disk, and network metrics.
- **Cloud Servers**: Integration with AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, and GCP Monitoring APIs.
- **Unified View**: Consistent dashboard for both cloud and on-premises resources.

## 5. Database Schema

### 5.1 MongoDB Collections
- **Services**: Service definitions, endpoints, and check configurations.
- **Servers**: Server metadata and resource configurations (Future).
- **Checks**: Check results and health status history.
- **Metrics**: Time-series performance data.
- **Incidents**: Service disruptions with resolution timelines.
- **Alerts**: Alert configuration and history.
- **Teams & Users**: Team structure, user accounts, and permissions.

## 6. Key Workflows

### 6.1 Service Monitoring Workflow
1. Scheduler triggers service checks.
2. Results are processed and health status determined.
3. Alerts are triggered if thresholds are exceeded.
4. Metrics are stored, and dashboards are updated.

### 6.2 Resource Monitoring Workflow (Future)
1. Agents or cloud APIs collect metrics.
2. Metrics are evaluated and stored.
3. Alerts are triggered for threshold violations.

### 6.3 Alert Processing Workflow
1. Alerts are triggered and routed.
2. Notifications are sent through configured channels (logging initially; notifications to be implemented later).
3. Escalation and resolution are tracked.

### 6.4 Incident Management Workflow
1. Related alerts are grouped into incidents.
2. Incidents are tracked and resolved with documented timelines.

## 7. Health Status Granularity

### 7.1 Status Levels
- **Healthy (Green)**: Optimal performance.
- **Degraded (Yellow)**: Below optimal thresholds.
- **Warning (Orange)**: Concerning metrics or partial failures.
- **Critical (Red)**: Severely impaired but partially responsive.
- **Down (Purple)**: Completely unavailable.

### 7.2 Health Score Calculation
- Weighted scoring based on response time, error rate, availability, and resource utilization.

---

## 8. Future Features
- **Server Resource Monitoring**: On-premises and cloud server metrics.
- **Notification Channels**: Email, SMS, Slack, and Microsoft Teams integration.
- **Cloud Integrations**: AWS, Azure, and GCP monitoring APIs.
- **Monitoring Agents**: Lightweight Node.js agents for on-premises servers.
